# Standard library

## STL vs standard library

The term `STL` is *not* mentioned in the C++ ISO standard.

It seems that it was once a separate library which heavily influenced the C++ ISO standrad when it was created.

Therefore: **never** use that word, unless you are really talking about the non stdlib library which has had most of its functionality implemented on the stdlib.

Write `stdlib` and say "Standard Library" instead.

## stdlib implementations

### GCC libstdc++

GCC comes with an implementation of libstdc++.

### Apache C++ Standard Library

Dead.
