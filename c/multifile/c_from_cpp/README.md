this dir demonstrates calling c code from cpp

I urge you to use `readelf -s` on the object files to see what they contain.

note that the symbols defined by the cpp compiler (thus when using `g++` instead of `gcc`)
are much more complicated than those generated by the c compiler.

this is probably the case because c++ has features like templates and classes,
so it must add preffixes and suffixes in an specific manne rto make the symbols unique.

therefore, it is much easier to call `c` from `c++` (with a c++ compiler)
rather than call `c++` from `c` (with a c compiler). Of course, this is beacause
`c++` was made to be backwards compatible with `c`.

see how `g++` links by default to the `c` standard libraries (for backwards compatibility)
since you can simply call functions like `printf` without linking.
