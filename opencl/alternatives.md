# Alternatives

## CUDA

NVIDIA's. More closed since controlled by NVIDIA. Also more popular for the same reason as they are the Top Dog now.

## RenderScript

Google's choice for Android: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14385843/why-did-google-choose-renderscript-instead-of-opencl>

Google somewhat opposes OpenCL, maybe because it was created by Apple?

## Vulkan

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_%28API%29>

Also by Khronos.

TODO why another?

- <http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/96014/what-is-vulkan-and-how-does-it-differ-from-opengl>

Derived from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_%28API%29> by AMD, now abandoned in favor of Vulkan, and will somewhat be the new OpenGL.

## Metal

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_%28API%29>

Apple's response to Google's RenderScript.

## DirectX

Microsoft, Windows, Xbox.
