Gnu extensions to libc in its implementation called glibc.

Extensions which are very thin interfaces to system calls will be documented together with system calls and not here.

glibc is what implements

- libc
- POSIX C APIs
- glibc extensions such as interfaces to sytem calls

in just about every Linux distro.

POSIX C API shall not be discussed, only points which are specific to glibc shall be discussed here.

Latest versions of the docs: <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> It is *highly* recommended that you get a copy of those and try to use it right away.
