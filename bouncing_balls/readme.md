Simple homework for my university, therefore simple implementation (not that I know how to do *that much* better now =) )

Homework requirements found in requirements.pdf.

To compile and run use:

    DIR_IN_PATH=~/bin
    wget -P "$DIR_IN_PATH" https://github.com/cirosantilli/bash/raw/ae0473cc9c29f98dfc0f02224c1f2b0b03b4b3f2/comprunglut 
    chmod +x "$DIR_IN_PATH"/comprunglut

    comprunglut one_ball.cpp 1
    comprunglut multi_ball.cpp 1
