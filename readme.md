Simple c and c++ programs, cheats and mini projects.

Larger projects may be in separate dirs.

There may be other compiled languages here for which I don't
have much material for a separate dir, specially when I interface
that language with c. Ex: fotran.

Non-portable features shall be clearly separated from portable ones
in either:

- ifdef blocks
- separate files
- separate directories
- separate repositories
