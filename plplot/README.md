linux/windows plotting library, with many language bindings.

plotting outputs types are called *devices*,
and can either be some window on the screen
or files. New ones can be added as plugins

#ubuntu install

main:

    sudo aptitude install libplplot-dev

x-win device for plotting on screen instead of to a file:

    sudo aptitude install plplot11-driver-xwin
