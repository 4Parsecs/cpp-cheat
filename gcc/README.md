# GCC

Cheat on the GNU Compile Collection (GCC) language extensions and command line utilities.

1. [main.c](main.c): main `gcc` cheat

## Scope

This will only cover C specifics. Generic ELF manipulation tools like `ld` (which can work across any language) are not included.

## Cross compile

Cross compiling means to compile a program for a different OS or architecture than the one the compiler is running.

GCC cannot cross compile for windows from Linux (TODO check).

This can be done with MinGW (TODO how).

## Infamous error messages

Error messages that are difficult to interpret for newbs:

- `struct has incomplete type = struct undefined`. You forgot to include some header.

## Generated assembly

This contains information that help to understand the assembly code generated by GCC, for example via the `-S` flag.

The generated assembly code is in the `gas` format. `gas` specific features shall not be explained here.

### Label name conventions

- `.L*`: local labels to current file
- `.LFB*`: function begin
- `.LFE*`: function end
- `.LC*`: function end
- `.LCFI`:
- `.LBB`:
- `.LBE`:
