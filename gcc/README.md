# GCC

Information about the Gnu Compile Collection (GCC), and in particular `gcc` and `g++`.

[main.c](main.c): `gcc` extensions to the ANSI C language.

GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection: *not* C compiler, and currently compiles: C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go.

`gcc` is the C compiler. It is a large frontend for other tools such as `as`, `cpp`.

`gcc` and `g++` are the dominant compilers on Linux. Important alternatives include `clang` and Intel's `icc`.

## g++ vs gcc

`g++`: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/172587/what-is-the-difference-between-g-and-gcc>

Most important:

1. `g++` treats both `.c` and `.cpp` files as C++, since `.c` is backwards compatible with C++, it works
2. `g++` links to (but does not include) stdlib automatically, `gcc` does not!

## Supported executable formats

- elf (linux)
- mach-o (mac os)
- pe (windows)

and more.

## Compilation steps

It is good to understand which steps are done towards compilation

Only expanded macros with the C preprocessor:

    cpp a.c > a.i
    cpp b.c > b.i

Different languages have different preprocessors

Generate human readable assembly code:

    gcc -S a.i -o a.s
    gcc -S b.i -o b.s

Specify format:

    gcc -masm=att -S a.c -o a.s
    gcc -masm=intel -S a.c -o a.s

Default format: `att` which is historically what has larger gcc support

Make machine code from assembly code:

    as -o a.o a.s
    as -o b.o b.s

This transforms human readable formats into binary object files

Make machine code from C directly:

    gcc -c a.c -o a.o
    gcc -c b.c -o b.o

All above steps in one

    ld -o ab.out a.o b.o

Link object files into single executable

    gcc a.c b.c -o ab.out

Does all above steps in one

If you use make, it is faster to generate `.o` and keep them, since if the source does not change, make will not recompile the corresponding `.o`

## Flags

### Recommended compilation flags

Good discussion: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/154630/recommended-gcc-warning-options-for-c>

Always use this for production output code if possible:

    gcc -std=c99 -pedantic-errors -Wall -Wextra -03 -march=native -o a a.c

This will make for portable, efficient code.

For test code, omit the `-03`, since that will make compilation faster.

### o

Output destination.

Default: `a.out`.

For stdout: `-o -`.

### Wall

Enables many useful warnings:

    gcc -Wall

Understanding each warning and being able to write warning free code is a good way to improve language skills.

### Wextra

Enables even more useful warnings than wall.

    `gcc -Wextra`

### std

Specifies the language to be used.

Disables GCC extensions that conflict with ANSI C standard.

Sample usage:

    gcc -std=c90
    gcc -std=c99
    gcc -std=1x

`c11` will be the next version and is still being developed at the time of writing.

To allow gnu extensions:

    gcc -std=gnu90

This is necessary on projects that rely on the extensions, such as the Linux kernel.

### ansi

Don't use this, use `std` instead:

    gcc -ansi

Implies the most recent `-std` which gnu considers is stable manner (not necessarily the latest).

Changes with time, currently equals:

    gcc -std=c90

It is a bit confusing not to have a fixed version of the standard to comply to, so just use std instead.

### pedantic

Give warnings for code that does not comply with `c1x` standard:

    gcc -std=c1x -pedantic

This does not mean *FULL* compliance, but greatly increases compliance.

There is currently no full compliance check in `gcc`.

Give errors instead of warnings:

    gcc -std=c1x -pedantic-errors

### march

Optimizes code to given CPU (arch is for archtecture).

May use instructions only available to given CPU.

Optimize for current compiling machine:

    gcc -march=native

Strict 80386 instruction set. old, compatible, used on almost all desktops and laptops:

    gcc -march=i386

Arm v.7, used on mobiles today:

    gcc -march=armv7

### Optimization

List possible optimizations for `-O`:

    gcc -Q -O --help=optimizers

The options:

- `O0`:    no speed optimization. This is the default
- `O` :    basic speed optimization. Same as `-O1`.
- `O2`:    more than O1
- `O3`:    more than O2
- `Og`:    optimize for debugging
- `Os`:    optimize for size
- `Ofast`: optimize for speed more than O3, *even if it breaks standards*

Best general code optimization method:

    gcc -O3 a.c -o a.out

Always use this for production code.

### debugging

GCC has options that allow you to add debugging information to binary outputs.

This leads to larger output files, but the information can then be used by programs such as gdb or objdump to help debug programs, or for educational purposes.

Add debug information to executable on compilation:

    gcc -ggdb3 a.c

Options:

- `g`:     generate debug info for GDB
- `ggdb`:  adds more info
- `ggdb3`: adds max info. Default if 2 when ggdb is used.

### M

Don't compile, but generate a list of dependencies for the given source code in a format suitable for a makefile rule, and output it to stdout.

Dependencies are basically the file itself and the required headers.

For example, in `a.c`:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "a.h"

then:

    gcc -M a.c

Output to stdout:

    a.c : /usr/include/stdio.h \
        a.h

To make this even more suitable for a makefile, you should suppress the standard system files with `-MM`:

    gcc -MM a.c

giving:

    a.c : a.h

You can then use those on a makefile as:

    $(shell gcc -MM a.c)
        gcc a.c

### assembly code

If you want to interpret assembly code generated by `gcc`, the best combo is:

    gcc -fverbose-asm -S a.c

To get original line number / code from C code into `asm` comments, use either:

    gcc -c -fverbose-asm -Wa,-adhln a.c

or:

    gcc -ggdb3 -o a.o a.c
    objdump -S a.o

#### -S

Generate assembly code:

    gcc -S a.c

Generates gas assembly code to a new file called `a.S`.

### -fverbose-asm

Outputs comments on the generated assembly which say variable names are being operated on each statement:

    gcc -fverbose-asm -S a.c

Sample C input:

    i = 1;
    j = i;

Output without `-fverbose-asm`:

    movl $1, -64(%ebp)
    movl -64(%ebp), %eax
    movl %eax, -68(%ebp)

With `-fverbose-asm`:

    movl $1, -64(%ebp)   # ,i
    movl -64(%ebp), %eax #i, tmp123
    movl %eax, -68(%ebp) #tmp123, j

### -f options

TODO What are the `-f` options for in general? Give examples.

### -Wa options

Same as `-Xassembler`.

Example:

    gcc -c -fverbose-asm -Wa,-adhln a.c


### -Xassembler

Pass options directly to the `as` assembler.

Example:

    gcc -c -fverbose-asm -Xassembler -adhln a.c

## Preprocessor

The executable is called `cpp`.

GCC uses it as a backend.

### -D option

Make preprocessor defines command line.

Defines can be made from command line arguments:

    gcc -DDEBUG -DLINELENGTH=80 -o c c.c

which is the same as adding:

    #define DEBUG
    #define LINELENGTH 80

to the top of file.

### find include search path

    echo '' | cpp -v

Look at sections:

- `include "..." search starts here`:
- `include <...> search starts here`:

#### -I option

Append to the include search path:

    gcc -I/new/include/location/ a.c

The above will not get appended to the existing search path.

For example, if `-Irel/` is used and `/usr/include/` is already on the search path, this does *not* mean that the file `/usr/include/rel/a.h`, can be included via `#include <a.h>`.

### View preprocessed file

This is mostly useful for learning purposes only.

Using `cpp` directly:

	cpp c.c

Outputs the preprocessed file to stdout.

Using `gcc` as a frontend:

    gcc -E c.c

## Cross compile

Cross compiling means to compile a program for a different OS or architecture than the one the compiler is running.

GCC cannot cross compile for windows from linux (TODO check).

This can be done with mingw (TODO how).

## Infamous error messages

Error messages that are difficult to interpret for noobs:

- `struct has incomplete type = struct undefined`. You forgot to include some header.

## Generated assembly

This contains information that help to understand the assembly code generated by gcc, for example via the `-S` flag.

The generated assembly code is in the `gas` format. `gas` specific features shall not be explained here.

### Label name conventions

- `.L*`:   local labels to current file
- `.LFB*`: function begin
- `.LFE*`: function end
- `.LC*`:  function end
- `.LCFI`:
- `.LBB`:
- `.LBE`:
