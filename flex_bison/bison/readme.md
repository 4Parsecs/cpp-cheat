this is the main bison cheat.

it is hard to test bison without flex, so they are used together here.

#cudos

i have taken this from a very good intro source:

[Tom Niemann - Lex & Yacc Tutorial](http://epaperpress.com/lexandyacc/)

and only made minor modfications (mostly annotations to explain what stuff does)

#features

it is a simple c-like calculator which supports:

- + - * /
- < > <= >= == !=
- variables
- if, if else, while

possible outputs:

- interpreter
- assembler
- visual ascii syntax tree

non-features:

- integers arithmetic only
- functions
- strings
