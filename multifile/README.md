# Multi-file operations

This dir demonstrates concepts which only make sense for multi-file compilation such as:

- #include statements
- static (`.a`) and dynamic (`.so`) creation/usage minimal example
- `static` and `extern` keywords
- two step `.c` -> `.o` -> executable Makefile compilation
- inter-language compilation: C, C++, Fortran
