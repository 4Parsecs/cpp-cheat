//#defines

    //these are headers specified by posix

    //on current ubuntu system this is implemented by the gnu c library:
    //<http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> says that POSIX compliance
    //is a design goal of the gnu c library

    //list of all headers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library

    //posix defines certain things **INSIDE**
    //headers with the same name as the ansi stdlib ones
    //which are only activated if you add the defines **before
    //including those files**!!

    //gcc: if you want to access them with the `-ansi -c99` flags,
    //you need to define `XXX_XOPEN_SOURCE`

    //TODO is there a windows implementation for those headers?

    //`POSIX_SOURCE` is another option which opens different functions.

    //the value refers to the actual posix version
    //for example:

    //- 500: issue 5, 1995
    //- 600: issue 6, 2004
    //- 700: issue 7, 2008

    //TODO what is th difference between:

#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 700
//#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200112L
//#define POSIX_SOURCE

    //basename, dirname operations:

//#ansi headers
