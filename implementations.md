# Implementations

## Compilers

Most of those compilers work for multiple related languages such as C, C++, etc.:

[GCC](gcc/) is arguably the most popular implementation.

### clang

LLVM.

### icc

Intel.

Has intrinsics for every Intel instruction, and optimizes assembly really well for Intel. 

Closed source...

### CompCert C compiler
